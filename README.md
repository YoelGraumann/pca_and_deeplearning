# Israeli 2021 Election Data Analysis using PCA.
In this project I analyzed the israeli 2021 election data set along with the israeli socio-economic ranking data set.
I used PCA to  profile the voters for each of the main parties, based on their socio-economic ranking. The findings were pretty cool to say the least.

## Project Overview:
This project could be split into 2 main parts:
* Part 1: PCA analysis of the election Data along with the socio-economic ranking data
* Part 2: In an attempt to practice my TensorFlow and Keras skills, i built a few MLP classification models to predict
the socio economic ranking of a city based on the votes each of the main party got in the said city. 
The accuracy ended up being bad but this is still good news for me, because I have learned a lot about Deep learning, MLPs and the importance of having 
a big data set.
